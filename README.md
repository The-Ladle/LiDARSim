# SteerClear
SteerClear is a coprocessor software designed to provide a 2d velocity vector and a 2d rotational velocity vector to an FRC robot via NetworkTables. Currently in the works, it would allow for theoretically perfect autodriving that avoids game pieces and other robots, as well as the rest of the field.
